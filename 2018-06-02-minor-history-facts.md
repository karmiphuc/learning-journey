TIL that Ancient Greek ruins were actually colourful. What's your favourite history fact that didn't necessarily make waves, but changed how we thought a period of time looked? (self.history)

King Louis XVI was a tinkerer and would often suggest modifications to inventors to improve upon their design. One item that he helped perfect was the guillotine by suggesting the blade should be at a diagonal to ensure a clean cut on the first attempt. This would prove to be the most effective method and is how we view the device today. The ironic part is that the guillotine would later be used on him after being dethroned during the French Revolution.

That Roman walls were covered in graffiti. There is a lot that is very relatable to anyone, for example

"We two dear men, friends forever, were here. If you want to know our names, they are Gaius and Aulus" was written next to a bar in Pompeii. Those could be any two guys going for a night out at any point in time.

"Caesius faithfully loves M[…name lost]" is really sad because the guys proclamation of love has survived for 2,000 years but the name of his lover has faded.

My fav is that the drab, grey interiors you always see when medieval castles are depicted are not accurate. When first being depicted in media, scholars lacked any artifacts indicating whether medieval Europeans had any wall decorations, such as tapestries. Thus, the artists left the walls bare for fear of erroneously assuming how medieval Europeans would have decorated.

This led to the assumption that medieval castles were without furnishings. However, later discoveries and excavations of castles across Europe have unearthed draperies with many bright colors. It has been proven that, even as far north as Northumbria, castles were artfully decorated, with the tapestries used to brighten the place and keep rooms warm.

Not just whitewashed. A restoration of Stirling castle in Scotland became very controversial when the restorers decided to go as close to the original look as the historical records show... which meant the great hall exterior was restored to a fabulous shade of yellow.

Dover Castle is a good example of this. The interior has been refurbished to as close as possible to the original interior. Most of furniture is painted in really bright primary colours, blue, red, green, yellow etc. Most of the stone walls are hidden behind tapestries, also in various bright colours. Only the rich could afford bright colours, so the richer you were the gaudier your residence. The thing is colours fade, paint peels and fabric rots over time, plus the old interiors have been refurbished many times over, removing any evidence of their colourful past.

I've always just assumed that castles were the medieval equivalent to mansions today. It was a huge structure compared to everything else, people that lived there were typically very wealthy in exchange for protection, so I figured they'd decorate as similar to rich people today as possible.

Think of them more as privately owned military installations that could double as nice estates for their owners.

The way the military is recruited and paid has changed dramatically in many ways since the castle was relevant, but the compressed version is that the castle served as a muster point, hardened supply depot, treasury, and stronghold before it fulfilled its secondary role as a noble's residence. They were hellishly expensive to build and maintain while being a strategically important defensive force multiplier, so that functionality had to be retained without adding things that would compromise it.

Ancient Rome and Ancient China were aware of each other. Each had heard accounts of the other great empire at the far end of the Silk Road, and they even tried to make direct diplomatic contact several times.

The Romans believed the distant empire of "Serica" was populated by tiny people (like pygmies), who built an empire surrounded by huge walls around a great river (possibly the Yellow River).

The Chinese spoke of the empire of "Daqin" in the west, which was famous for its roads and postal network, and where "kings were not permanent" and would be chosen and replaced based on merit during times of crisis, a clear reference to the Roman Republic.

A few years ago, the University of Washington’s John E. Hill drafted an English copy of the Weilüe, a third century C.E. account of the interactions between the Romans and the Chinese, as told from the perspective of ancient China[...] The translated text gives a curious look at the way of life of third century Rome, a land ruled by “numerous minor kings.” The chronicle even comes with extensive directions on how to get there—go across the Indian Ocean, cut up to Egypt, duck through the Nile, sail across the Mediterranean (about six days) until you find yourself in Da Qin, the Roman Empire.

Pirates tried to make themselves look scary rather than pretty, but they did put a lot of effort into appearances.

Here's what I found on google. The paint meeting oxygen thing is just a translation I heard when touring the museum in Xi'an.

The figures were originally coated with an East Asian lacquer, so-called qi lacquer. The artists then placed layers of paint on top of the lacquer. Egg was used as the binding agent. When the figures are removed from the damp earth, the moisture in the lacquer evaporates. The lacquer shrinks and the paint flakes off.

[–]TheChairHugger

I visited Xi'An years back and the museum explained how the relatively crude excavation process is responsible for the paint wearing off. When a smaller set of figures was found years after they were able to better conserve the paint.

Also interesting is that the soldiers originally held bronze weapons, depending on their rank. These were pillaged long before the figures were rediscovered.

edit: *extraction -> excavation

Well thankfully there are still many of the original figures still earthed* (thanks for the typo fix). They keep them that way to preserve the color until they have the proper technology to preserve them. Hands down one of the coolest places to visit in China and the world.

Archaeology was a really big deal in ancient Mesopotamia.

The Assyrian king Ashurbanipal compiled a vast collection of texts thousands of years older than his own empire, and ended up (allegedly) amassing more literature than the library of Alexandria.
In the 500s BCE, the city of Ur had its own archaeology museum, curated by a priestess / princess called Ennigaldi-Nanna. All the artifacts were organized according to period and region, and tagged with labels -- in fact, many of them had been collected by the priestess's father, the Babylonian emperor Nabonidus, who financed loads of archaeological digs all over Mesopotamia.
Monks from ancient Mesopotamian temples would explore the ruins of temples thousands of years older, take clay impressions and notes on the artifacts they found there, and bring the records back to their own archives. These ancient lists of far more ancient texts have actually been really helpful to modern archaeologists!
I could talk about this all day; it's basically my favorite thing in the world.

Actually, this brings up a really fascinating point: tens of thousands of ancient Mesopotamian texts are sitting in museum archives around the world, untranslated. Take a look at the CDLI archive, for example, and you'll see that some of the texts haven't even been transcribed, let alone analyzed in any in-depth way.

And every now and then, someone comes along and translates one of them, and finds something amazing.

For example, translators in Turkey recently discovered a “lost” Mesopotamian language. Just imagine that — the sole written record of an entire culture’s existence, buried in the dirt through across thousands of years, just because no one picked up that particular text and read it.

And in 2015, researchers translated a lost passage of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and discovered a previously unknown backstory on one of the characters. Literature professors all around the world had been describing the character Humbaba as a big elephant-like monster, based on context cues... but this new passage reveals that he's actually more of a Robin Hood-like "king of the forest," entertained in his court by a symphony of birds and wild beasts. How's that for some Deep Lore?

In case this isn't clear, a lot of these ancient Mesopotamian texts have been digitally scanned and uploaded... it's just that literally no one has ever tried to read them.

They're just sitting there, freely available on the internet, waiting for the right pair of eyes.

The more interesting part is not that our view of the Greeks was wrong, but that incorrect view actually caused us to change ourselves.

As a quick example look at the monuments in Washington DC. Lincoln, Jefferson etc..., or the buildings. All have this white motif because thats what the Greeks did.

My guess is this would go far beyond architecture, and into the realm of society. Those things that survived from bygone eras are not always that which we think they are. So we built our society based on half-truths and misinterpretations on what the past thinks.

The pictures of the recreations bring down the realism so much. It makes me wonder if they were actually painted very skillfully (this is a society that made very detailed sculptures, after all) and the recreations just aren't accurate enough to recreate the original effect.

I tend to think that, given the tremendous artistic skills of the Greek sculptors, that the painter's skills were no less impressive. I'm not convinced by some of those recreations, and was impressed by a show at Ps1, a museum in NYC, where an Italian artist used a combination of encaustic and tempera paint to "colorize" ancient busts he'd bought on the antique markets. He's recreations are far more subtle than the gaudy ones I've seen floating around. I also imagine that if the Greeks did use encaustics (which would have resulted in painted surfaces with far more depth than the flat, pink flesh tones recreated by archeologists) then they would have fared even worse than the egg tempera remnants that we only have inklings of today. Wax is a far less strong and easily preserved medium than tempera, and would have easily disappeared early on.

Edit: the artist I mentioned is Francesco Vezzoli and te show was titled "Teatro Romano"

Most British moorland isn't natural. It used to be heavily forested until bronze-age Brits chopped it all down for farming land which they were then forced off by changing climate.

Also, medieval forests (at least near settlements) were "farmed", in the sense that a large amount of the trees were grown in specific unnatural ways and shapes in order to be used by people.

A lot of European Gothic cathedrals are constructed out of sandstone. Sandstone has aged over the centuries to obtain a greyish/greenish/blackish tint. However since the Gothic style was revolutionary with how much light it let in and in combination with the bright stone must have been truly awe aspiring.

Alexander the Great wanted to invade a small City known as Tyre. But, the problem was, the city was on an island and he had no access to a Navy.

So, this crazy bastard had his army stack stones across the Mediterranean from modern day Lebanon just to make a bridge to cross. The entire time his men were having arrows fired at them and the entire project was a living hell.

But he won.

And killed all the men, or crucified them along the cities walls, and sold the women and children into slavery in order to pay his men so he could then move on.

Medieval feasts weren't bland or crude.

Medieval cooks used plenty of spices, like ginger, cumin, cardamom, etc.

It "was not unlike Indian food of today: sweet and acidic flavors combined, spices used by the handful. If anything, the concentrated, bold flavors would overwhelm the modern palate."

Also, they had some crazy concoctions:

Peacocks were cooked, then returned to their skin to be ceremoniously presented in their original plumage.
Animals were stuffed inside other animals like culinary matrioshka dolls—a pig stuffed with a rooster, which would itself be stuffed with roasted pine nuts and sugar.
A recipe called "glazed pilgrim" consisted of a pike boiled at the head, fried in the middle, and roasted at the tail; this was then served alongside a roast eel

Not as specific as that, but I love colorized black and white pictures for the same reason. There's something inhuman about sepiatone or true black and white, but when you add human skin tones and eye colors, people who look "old timey" suddenly look like people you could know. It really bridges a gap, I think our perception of Historical figures is now in 3 broad categories: color photo, black and white photo, and pre-photo. Colorized photos can blur that first divide, which I find fascinating.

Neanderthals used plants with antibiotic properties to treat inflammation.

Also they had as much brain as homo sapiens just not on top of their head but at the back of their. This probably resulted in them processing visual information better. This is also visible in the tools they made. Their spearheads look a bit rough in our eyes but where made with a lot of understanding. They used a lot less blows to the stones using physics to do a lot of the work.

They used a mixture wich was very sticky to connect the spearhead to the spear (homo sapiens didn't use it). This mixture has a complex recipe and it is safe to assume they had some kind of language and culture because more then one clan used it.

As a whole, people have always been very clever.

When thinking of ancient people you have to remember that they weren't dumb. Not having the wheel, not having electricity, not having cell phones or the internet doesn't mean that people use to be dumb. Native American groups HAD the technology for the wheel, they used wheels in making children's toys. They did NOT have any large domesticates like cows or horses to pull a cart, so wheels were relegated to children's toys.

Maybe a bit off the request for aesthetic cases, but "The Wild West" did not have the gun culture depicted.

Guns were common in the frontier, as livestock predators and Indian raids were frequent risks, and there was a need to hunt.

However, most towns had strict gun control, you had to check your piece in with the sheriff when you came in. Guns were not carried inside saloons. Which basically means people more or less had to check in with the local sheriff, not just walk up and be there unannounced.

There is no known case of a "duel at high noon in the street".

The great Famine of Ireland of 1845 We all died because the only source of food on our tiny island was potatoes. Come on. We are one of the most fertile places in the world. We actually had lots of grain, cattle, pigs, poultry and so on...but it wasn't for us, it was exported to the UK as we were under UK rule at the time. We fled the land and became refugees in many parts of the world and not just the US. We are also not taught this in our history books in Ireland, it was just all because of a potato disease.

x-posting a comment of mine from another thread on this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/6euaou/what_ignorance_of_ireland_really_boils_your_piss/didnofq/

I've made it my personal mission to educate as many people as will listen every time I hear the term "Potato Famine".

As my father explained when I was a lad, 'how can an island nation starve? Well, when the most powerful navy in the world tells you you can't fish, you don't fish.'

During the famine, more than 100 boats left Irish ports per day laden with corn, wheat, barley, and dairy to feed British troops overseas while the Irish starved.

It's brilliant to watch the proverbial light bulb go on over people's heads when they catch on that potatoes were all that were available to eat because they were the only thing hardy enough to grow in the rocky soil that couldn't be used to grow crops for British consumption.

It wasn't a "famine". It was genocide.

When the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire wanted to send £10000 to aid the Irish queen victoria insisted he only send £1000 (she had sent only £2000). So against the wishes of the English he sent 5 ships laden with food to Drogheda. Drogheda still has a crescent as part of its crest (though some argue this is not linked to the sultan)

The Filibustering era in the mid 1800s is probably one of the most interesting periods in American history. This was when Manifest Destiny was at its height, and politicians and ordinary people were captivated by westward expansion and the prospect of Cuban statehood.

One of these Filibusters was William Walker, a Tennessee-born physician, lawyer, and filibuster. Walker eventually ended up in California, as many others did during the 1840-50s, and eventually mustered up men to form a short-lived republic in the Mexican Sonora and Baja Peninsula. After being run out of Mexico, he went down to Nicaragua to support a rebellion, and through a military coup, Walker became the President of Nicaragua for about a year.

Prior to European contact the majority of native Americans were farmers living in houses and walled towns and cities, with north america reasonably heavily populated (not nearly as much as south america though). With a number of factors (including disease) there was a major collapse for many native civilisations around the 16th century, causing later English to find mostly only smaller villages when they expanded inward. For example look up the Mound builder civilisation encountered by the earliest explorers.

Most images we have today of natives are derived from plains/nordic/pacific natives groups, essentially those who live in harsher and more isolated areas and thus survived much longer independently leaving a more recent memory.

A couple things:

-Even though according to ancient literature (probably mythical) states the Spartan invented the sport of boxing, they actually refused to compete in it under the premise that it was shameful to concede defeat.

-Most of Alexander the Great's best veteran soldiers were no younger than 60. They were battle hardened veterans of many engagements, highly loyal to both each other and Alexander, and were drilled and versed in tactics (like being able to form pike squares).

-Rome had 2 level shopping malls and flushable toilets, which even professions like merchants and traders could afford

Edit: Alexander the Great would leave behind pieces of armor that only a giant could wear, so when locals looted the battlefields they brought back stories of Greeks the size of giants in Alexander's army

I discovered in Erich Neumann's "The Origins and History of Consciousness" that primitive people did not know that sex led to women bearing children. Here's the relevant passage:

"Many primitive peoples do not recognize the connection between sexual intercourse and birth. Where, as among primitives, sexual intercourse often begins in childhood but does not lead to the begetting of children, it is natural to conclude that the birth of the child has nothing to do with impregnation by a man in the sexual act."

This blew my away, partly because I'd always imagined that primitive woman chose a mate with the conscious understanding that this man would provide for her children. In fact, the selection process was largely unconscious.

There's still debate surrounding this, but some specific references to "washing feet" in the bible may not have referred to feet, but to genitals. Particularly, the book of Ruth may have included what essentially amount to euphemistic language that was translated in an overly literal sense. In my google search on the topic, I found pages that implied that other references to "feet" in the bible were, in fact, references to the genital region, such as the description of seraphim who had six pairs of wings, one pair to keep them aloft, one pair covering their mouths, and one pair covering their "feet."

I'm not a historian by any means, but this is a rumor/factoid/fact that I keep hearing over and over, from both within and without the church-going community, and I was able to come up with numerous sources/discussions on the topic just by googling it. Even if it's 100% false, it makes for an interesting re-reading of the old and new testament.

Gay lovers were held in very high regard in Sparta, and they were typically placed on the same platoon. It was thought that they'd work hard to impress each other.

My understanding is that this was about fighting harder to save your lover than your buddy.

There was a Theban army that consisted of gay lovers. The quote beneath the pic in the formation drop down explains the idea behind it. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Band_of_Thebes

They were also the first army to be outnumbered by Spartans and still win.

They mastered flanking with troop movements.

Also, if one of them was killed the enemy had a very pissed off Spartan to deal with. The Sacred Band of Thebes had similar policies.

I heard in a college class that the Spartans viewed gay sex as the epitome of masculinity.

History was a lot more colourful than movies would have you believe. Even the Pyramids would have been brightly coloured in their hay day.

We've also known the Earth is a globe for the better part of 2 millenniums and at no point in that time has the Church ever called it heresy to claim otherwise.

One bit of fun trivia for me is that the Southern secession that started the Civil War was not the first attempt at secession in the US. That honor actually goes to the New England states with the Hartford Convention in 1814, citing the war and the need to curtail federal powers as means for secession from the Union.

This wasn't the first attempt at secession either. Aaron Burr, former Vice President to Jefferson, fled to the West in order to start a Seccesionist movement. Burr was arrested for treason, and then fled to Europe to convince France and England to stop their wars (haha) and align with each other to take down the US and support revolution in Mexico to form a country through the center of the NA continent.

Seriously, when I checked Wikipedia to see what happened to Aaron Burr after the events of the Hamilton musical, I was very, very surprised.
