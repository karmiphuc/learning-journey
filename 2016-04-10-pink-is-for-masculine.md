> <p>In the 20th century, pinks became bolder, brighter, and more assertive, in part because of the invention of chemical dyes which did not fade. The pioneer in the creation of the new wave of pinks was the Italian designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsa_Schiaparelli" title="Elsa Schiaparelli">Elsa Schiaparelli</a>, (1890-1973) who was aligned with the artists of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist" title="Surrealist" class="mw-redirect">surrealist</a> movement, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau" title="Jean Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a>. In 1931 she created a new variety of the color, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shocking_pink" title="Shocking pink" class="mw-redirect">Shocking pink</a>, made by mixing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magenta" title="Magenta">magenta</a> with a small amount of white. She launched a perfume called Shocking, sold in a bottle in the shape of a woman's torso, said to be modelled on that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_West" title="Mae West">Mae West</a>. Her fashions, co-designed with artists such as Cocteau, featured the new pinks.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></p>

> <p>The transition to pink as a sexually differentiating color for girls occurred gradually, through the selective process of the marketplace, in the 1930s and 40s. In the 1920s, some groups had been describing pink as a masculine color, an equivalent of the red that was considered to be for men, but lighter for boys. But stores nonetheless found that people were increasingly choosing to buy pink for girls, and blue for boys, until this became an accepted norm in the 1940s.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-npr-pink_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-npr-pink-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
