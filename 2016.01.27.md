## Increase the Battery Life of your Mouse

Speaking of battery life, here are some additional tips courtesy [Logitech] that may further push the battery life of your wireless mouse.

* Get a light-colored mouse pad. While your mice may work well on your black granite table or even transparent surfaces like glass, they are best avoided as they cause the tracking sensor in the mouse to use more power.
* Your wireless mouse ships with a nano receiver that is put into the USB port of your computer. Make sure the USB receiver and the mice are close to each other else use an USB extension cable for the receiver.
* For best results, replace both batteries at the same time and avoid mixing brands. Logitech suggests using alkaline batteries as non-alkaline batteries, such as NiMH or NiCd, operate at a lower voltage and may negatively impact the battery life of your mouse.
* Turn off the mouse manually when you are travelling. While the mice may go to sleep /standby mode when not being used, theyâ€™ll wake up when they move around inside your bag and this consumes battery power.
