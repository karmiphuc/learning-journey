The coolest IFTTTs I've heard of were parts of an elaborate scheme from a professional photographer friend. His workflow is roughly:

- His camera has an Eye-Fi card which creates its own wifi network
- Eye-Fi app on phone connects to card, syncs to camera roll.
- IFTTT sync from iPhone album to Dropbox backup, in-camera star rating preserved in meta/EXIF tags.
- 5-star rating photos get pushed to Flickr set for the event at full-res.
- Automatic watermarking (via PicMarkr?)
- Sync from Flickr sets to Facebook albums of same name.
- People at event and at home follow him on Facebook, tag themselves in realtime, etc.

IFTTT
My favorite (and arguably highest ROI) recipe is when I tag an Instagram with #fam, email it to my mother. She doesn't understand it, but she loves it.

I'm currently running 7 recipes:

- Fav a tweet & save to Pocket
- Text me tomorrow's forecast before bedtime
- Buffer your watch later YouTube videos
- Receive an email when a NYT Tech article becomes popular
- Rent reminder
- If tomorrow's forecast calls for rain send me a text
- Send IFTTT any text message and add it to Buffer

1. Re-inject tweets that I've fav'd
When I fav a tweet (as @kaz), it gets sent to Buffer. Some time passes (based on buffer settings) and then that tweet is posted to @kazfavs...I follow kazfavs ;) and then get to re-enjoy the original tweet. Helpful when tweets are inspirational or worthy of additional contemplation.

2. Reflective questions
Every sunday night, I get a series of questions in a google form sent to me...link takes me to the form and I answer em. Inspired by @davidspinks http://quibb.com/links/7-reflective-questions-i-ask-myself-every-sunday/view
