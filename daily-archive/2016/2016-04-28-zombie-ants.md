Read an interesting Quora question [here](https://www.quora.com/Can-ants-get-sick-If-so-what-happens-when-they-get-sick-What-do-they-do) and came upon this amazing answer:

> They die. The question is where: because ants live so close together, they are at risk of infection, so ants actually do take care of public health.

> The big problems are fungal diseases: the infected ants eventually become eaten away from the inside with fungus, until the ant becomes nothing but an incubator for spores. A famous example is Ophiocordyceps unilateralus (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...). The fungus eventually infests the brain and makes the ant climb up a leaf and hold tight, then die in this position. A fruiting body eventually bursts out of the ant corpse and a few days later sprays a cloud of spores out that infects everyant nearby. These are the "zombie" ants you may have heard of, and entire colonies can be eradicated by the fungus. Some ants can tell if a nestmate is infected early, and will discard them in the colony graveyard/dump or even take them far away to a distant place before they become zombies to make sure nobody is around to get infected.

> Another ant disease is infection hy a fluke, Dicrocoelium dendriticum (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...). The fluke lives in snails and sheds its cysts in the slime that ants use for moisture. The fluke infects the ant brain, and every night infected ants go outside, climb the tops of blades of grass, hold on tight and wait. The hope (for the fluke) is that the ant gets accidentally eaten by a cow grazing the grass, and then the fluke infests the cow. The flukes make eggs that are shed in cow dung and get picked up by snails, and the cycle continues. If the ant does not get eaten, then **at dawn she climbs down and  home to start a new day's work.**

> Another parasite is the nematode, Myrmeconema neotropicum (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...). This too is not a public health issue for the colony, but is fatal to the ant. The nematode infects the ant abdomen, making it bright red and bulbous. The ants walk slower and hold their abdomen up more. The result us fruit eating birds confuse the ant butt for a berry and eat it. This kills the ant, but lets the nematode infest the bird and continue its life cycle.

> Bacterial and viral ant diseases likely exist too, but the zombification parasites and fungi are much more noticable and newsworthy.
