I've done work on dehydration for the Army. Thirst is NOT a reliable indicator unless under circumstances that you are very acclimated to. Used to living in the Northeast and not doing much physical labor? You'll find you can't rely on your thirst to tell you when to drink if you suddenly are doing a lot of work in the sun, or if you're sent to a climate where the temperature is high but the humidity is low. 

This is really, really important to understand. Yes, if you live in an area for a long time, and you're doing things you do most of the time, you can probably rely on your body to tell you when to drink. But if you either go somewhere with a markedly different climate, or you (like some "weekend warriors") go from sedentary to spending a few hours doing heavy labor, you CANNOT trust your body's signals and have to pay much, much more conscious attention to hydration. Dehydration KILLS people; in the big heat wave through Europe in (IIRC) 2005, literally TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE died because they were in conditions that they were unused to, and did not realize that they had to drink more water.
