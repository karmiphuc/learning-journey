[Quoting Wikipedia][1]:

> On Unix-like operating systems (including BSD, GNU/Linux and Mac OS
> X), tilde often indicates the current user's home directory: for
> example, if the current user's home directory is `/home/bloggsj`, then
> `cd`, `cd ~`, `cd /home/bloggsj` or `cd $HOME` are equivalent. This practice
> derives from the Lear-Siegler ADM-3A terminal in common use during the
> 1970s, which happened to have the tilde symbol and the word "Home"
> (for moving the cursor to the upper left) on the same key.

This terminal is also the [source of shortcuts][4] used in the `vim` editor: <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd> for left, down, up, right.
